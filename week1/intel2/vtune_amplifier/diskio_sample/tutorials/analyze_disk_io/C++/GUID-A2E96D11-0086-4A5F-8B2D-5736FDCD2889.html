		<span id="GUID-1389924F-A9CF-4854-B219-2C0058EE28C9">A performance metric used as a basis for comparison
          of the application versions before and after optimization. Baseline should be
          measurable and reproducible.</span></p>
<p id="CPU_TIME"><strong>CPU Time</strong>: The time during which the CPU is actively executing your
		application. 
	 </p>
<p id="CPU_ACTIVITY"><strong>CPU Activity</strong>: A metric that defines a portion
		of time the system spent in the following states: 
	 </p>
<ul id="GUID-452BA89E-F791-4228-97F8-46E86893DE37"><li><p>Idle state - the CPU core is idle. 
		  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Active state - the CPU core is executing a thread. 
		  </p>
</li>
<li><p>I/O Wait - the CPU core is idle but there is a thread, blocked by an
			 access to the disk, that could be potentially executed on this core. 
		  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="ELAPSED_TIME"><strong id="GUID-ADFC3A88-1880-4C9C-A6B5-90463CDDB238">Elapsed Time</strong>:<span id="GUID-A81A2BD3-C85A-4840-A210-D137FB812249">The total time your target ran, calculated as
          follows: 
          <strong id="d10e56">Wall clock time at
            end of application – Wall clock time at start of application</strong>. 
        </span></p>
<p id="FINALIZATION"><strong>finalization</strong>: A process during which the 
		<span>Intel&reg; VTune&#8482; Amplifier</span>
		converts the collected data to a database, resolves symbol information, and
		pre-computes data to make further analysis more efficient and responsive. 
	 </p>
<p id="HOTSPOT"><strong id="GUID-C7660F2E-336F-4BC3-A580-1A175646ACB5">hotspot</strong>: A section
		of code that took a long time to execute. Some hotspots may indicate
		bottlenecks and can be removed, while other hotspots inevitably take a long
		time to execute due to their nature. 
	 </p>
<p id="TRANSFER"><strong>I/O Data Transfer</strong>: A metric that shows the number
		of bytes read from or written to the storage. 
	 </p>
<p id="QUEUE"><strong>I/O Queue Depth</strong>: A metric that shows the number of I/O
		requests submitted to the storage device. Zero requests in a queue means that
		there are no requests scheduled and disk is not used at all. 
	 </p>
<p id="IO_TIME"><strong>I/O Wait Time</strong>: A metric that shows a portion of time when threads
		reside in I/O wait state while there are idle cores on the system and the
		number of counted threads is not greater than the number of idling cores. 
	 </p>
<p id="PAGE"><strong>Page Faults</strong>: A metric that shows the number of page
		faults occurred on a system. This metric is useful when analyzing access to
		memory mapped files. 
	 </p>
<p id="PCIE"><strong>PCIe Bandwidth</strong>: A metric that represents an amount of
		data transferred via the PCIe bus per second. This metric is collected only on
		server platforms based on Intel microarchitecture code name Sandy Bridge EP and
		later. 
	 </p>
<p><strong>project</strong>: A container for an analysis target and analysis type
		configuration and data collection results.
	 </p>
<p id="TARGET"><strong id="GUID-5EAB21BB-5400-4754-A1A7-51D99CDB8A94">target</strong>:

<p id="VIEWPOINT"><strong id="GUID-1B5043B8-253D-4758-A765-3CDCD11AD26C">viewpoint</strong>: A preset
		result tab configuration that filters out the data collected during a
		performance analysis and enables you to focus on specific performance problems.
		When you select a viewpoint, you select a set of performance metrics the VTune
		Amplifier shows in the windows/panes of the result tab. To select the required
		viewpoint, click the 
		<strong>(<u>change</u>) 
		</strong>link at the top of the result tab and use the drop-down menu to
		select a required viewpoint.
